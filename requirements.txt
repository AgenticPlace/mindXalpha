# Core Runtime Dependencies for MindX
psutil>=5.9.0               # For ResourceMonitor (CPU, memory, disk usage)

# LLM SDKs - Install based on which providers you intend to use
# These are needed if the LLMHandlers use the official SDKs.
# The current LLMFactory stubs can run without these if you only use the mock,
# but for real LLM interaction, you'll need them.

google-generativeai>=0.5.0  # For GeminiHandler

# To be added if/when other specific LLM provider handlers are implemented:
# openai>=1.3.0
# anthropic>=0.20.0
# litellm>=1.30.0           # Good for abstracting multiple LLM APIs if you go that route
